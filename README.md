# 2DPrototype

Updates:

Day 1: Just importing the framework of a previous project to this one to help reuse code. This also has imported new assets to use, changes done to the first level and the
player character and making changes to the code from the previous project to help with the vision of the overall project.

Day 2: Finished building the level for the project through placing all the spawn points of each object. enemies are now spawned into the map as well as ability to take damage and gain a game over upon reaching 0 health.

Day 3: Added in the function toward the player to obtain scores of each coin collect, the ability to collect the key to use to exit the level, health pickup that restore a unit of health and finally a speedup item that increases the player speed for a short time.

Day 4: Added in the function toward the player to have the ability to fire their weapon which works by generating bullets from the player postition and then destroy it when collided with the platform and the enemy. If collided with the enemy, they will also be destroyed at the same time.

Day 5: Improvement made on the shooting mechanic previously added by allowing the player to shoot projectiles from the left when facing that direction and collision changes done on destorying the bullet on world boundary.

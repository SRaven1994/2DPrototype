# 2DPrototype

Updates:
Day 1: Just importing the framework of a previous project to this one to help reuse code. This also has imported new assets to use, changes done to the first level and the
player character and making changes to the code from the previous project to help with the vision of the overall project.

Day 2: Finished building the level for the project through placing all the spawn points of each object. enemies are now spawned into the map as well as ability to take damage and gain a game over upon reaching 0 health.
